Welcome to the GH repo for the DSTA module.
The repo mirros what is normally available from Download on Moodle or on the [satellite site](https://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/~ale/dsta/).

It contains all materials (lectures, codes, notebooks) seen in class.
Feel free to fork it to create your own class notes.
