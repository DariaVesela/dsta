# Data Science: Techniques and Applications (DSTA)

## A new[ish] module

* Designed for MSc Data Science students

* Contents carefully dovetail with existing MSc DS modules

. . .  

#### we are in this together

<!--------------------------------------------------->
## Main topics

* Python modules for DS, `Numpy,` `Pandas,` `Matplotlib` and `Scikit-learn.`

* The geometric view of multidimensional data (Lin. Algebra)

* The data-as-network view (graph algo.)

* the text-as-data view (Information Theory)

* a motivating DS problem: sports ranking
  
* selected topics: matrix *slicing:* finding latent dimensions to datasets.  
  
* [discontinued: handling exponentially-distributed data]

<!--------------------------------------------------->
## Important aspects

The inevitable *overfitting* to MSc DS may make this module less appealing to MSc ACT students than the title suggests

. . .

Machine Learning topics are selected so as not to overlap the essential Machine Learning and Applied ML modules.

-----

The table of contents is varied and may appear syncretic wrt. traditional, textbook-based modules..  

. . .

This is a *final* module in charge of synthetising a large, fast-moving area.

. . .

so, expect a more seminarial (than textbook) approach.

## A successful module

# Assessment

## Coursework

For the first time, coursework will take the form of an in-class, multiple-choice test via Codio/ Moodle.

On Week 6 (May 28th) at 20:00 for about 30/40 minutes.

10 questions on the 10 foundational units: from 2.b to 4.c (see the [online calendar](https://github.com/ale66/dsta)).

In view of the novelty of the approach, marks will be awarded generously, but always at the discretion of the School's [Exam board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spanish_Inquisition_(Monty_Python)).

<!-- ----------------------------------------------- -->
## Final test

For the first time, the final test will take the form of an in-class, multiple-choice test via Codio/ Moodle.

On the final Week 11 (July 2nd) at 19:00 for about 60/80 minutes.

20 questions on the 20 advanced units: from 4.d to 10.c but excludind the notebooks on 7.d, 8.d, 9.d and 10.d (see the [online calendar](https://github.com/ale66/dsta)).

In view of the novelty of the approach ...
